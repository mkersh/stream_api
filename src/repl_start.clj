;; This is the main function that will get called when you start using:
;; lein run
;; NOTE: The :main tag in project.clj determines what namespace/file to start in and will look for 
;; a -main function in here. The project.clj defines ":main repl_start" and so the -main below
;; is the startup function for us.
